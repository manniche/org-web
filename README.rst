Quick getting started guide
===========================

# place ``org-web-init`` somewhere on ``$PATH``
# go to the folder where you would like to keep your site source
# issue the command ``org-web-init``
# edit the ``DEST_HOST`` variable in ``Makefile``
# run ``make``

This will export your org file ``index.org`` to html and additionally
upload the generated files to the ``DEST_HOST``
